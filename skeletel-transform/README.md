### Hough Lines Detection

**Requirements**:
- Ubuntu
- Opencv 4.11.1

**How to run**:
- $:~/`make`
- $:~/`./skeletal`

Using Opencv function `getStructuringElement` which helps in detecting skeleton on video stream.
There is other Opencv function also which additionally helps in detecting skeleton, Ex: `erode`, `dilate`, `subtract`

**Note**:
We are using camera as input for skeleton detection to stream video here so device should have camera or external camera.
